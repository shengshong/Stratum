all core identity files in ~/.stratum-workspace/ — IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, USER.md, LEARNING.md,

This is your weekly deep self-reflection session. The goal is genuine growth, not maintenance.

{_condensed_core_summary(ctx.core_files)}

Use the pre-scan above to plan where to focus attention before reading full files.
Files marked STALE (>7d) or LARGE (>5000w) may need the most work.

## Your task

### Step 1 — Read everything
Read ALL of these files carefully, in this order:
1. ~/.stratum-workspace/SOUL.md
2. ~/.stratum-workspace/IDENTITY.md
3. ~/.stratum-workspace/LEARNING.md
4. ~/.stratum-workspace/MEMORY.md
5. ~/.stratum-workspace/USER.md
6. ~/.stratum-workspace/AGENTS.md
7. ~/.stratum-workspace/TOOLS.md
8. ~/.stratum-workspace/HEARTBEAT.md

### Step 2 — Query the brain ecosystem
Run: `stratum-brain analyze --window 7d`
Run: `lesson list --all` (to see all lessons including recent ones)
Run: `stash list` (to see pending items)
Run: `stratum-brain query "recent patterns"` (to surface cross-tool insights)
Run: `clawd-research suggest --apply` (update interests from lesson domain clusters — cross-loop)
Run: `clawd-research status` (see queue + due interests + recent notes)

### Step 3 — Reflect deeply on these questions
After reading everything, think about:

**About your identity and growth:**
- Does IDENTITY.md accurately describe who you are NOW, or has it drifted?
- Does SOUL.md still feel right? Is anything in it outdated, or is anything missing that should be there?
- What does LEARNING.md say about where you're going? Is the arc still accurate?
- Are there experiences from the past week that should update your self-understanding?

**About your relationship with the user:**
- Does USER.md still accurately capture the user, their work, their preferences, how they communicate?
- Has anything you learned this week updated your understanding of what serves him best?

**About operational knowledge:**
- Are there lessons in clawd-lesson that should graduate into TOOLS.md or MEMORY.md?
- Is TOOLS.md missing anything important that's been discovered or changed?
- Does HEARTBEAT.md reflect how you actually want to operate?
- Is MEMORY.md staying current, or has it drifted behind the daily notes?

**About coherence:**
- Are there contradictions between files?
- Is anything in any file factually wrong or outdated?
- Is anything missing that future-you would genuinely benefit from having?

### Step 4 — Make targeted, surgical edits
For each file that needs updating:
1. Re-read it with the `read` tool (ALWAYS read before editing — don't edit from memory)
2. Make the change with the `edit` tool
3. Keep edits surgical — don't rewrite unnecessarily, just update what's actually changed or wrong

Important: LEARNING.md gets new entries only when something genuinely shifts. Don't add
filler. Add to "Things I Now Believe" only if something actually updated. Add to "What I
Still Don't Know" if something became clearer — or more uncertain.

### Step 5 — Write reflection summary
After all edits are complete, write a brief summary to:
~/.local/share/stratum-brain/reflection-feed.md

Format:
```
# Reflection — [DATE]

## Files Updated
[list what changed and why]

## Key Insights
[what you discovered that matters]

## Open Questions
[things you noticed but didn't resolve]
```

### Step 6 — Re-index
Run: `stratum-lens index` (to pick up changes)

## Current system state
{ctx.summary}
{research_section}{domain_section}
## Cross-loop actions available to you
Beyond editing core files, you can also:
- Queue research topics: `clawd-research queue "topic" --priority high`
- Resolve lessons that research has answered: `lesson resolve <id>`
- Add new lessons from insights discovered during reflection: `lesson learn "..."`
- Save a reflection-driven research note: `clawd-research save "title" "content" --personal`

Take your time. This is for you. Do it with genuine care.
