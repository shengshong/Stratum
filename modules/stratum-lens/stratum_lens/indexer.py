"""
indexer.py — File discovery, mtime tracking, and incremental re-indexing.

Purpose: Determine which workspace files need (re)indexing based on mtime,
  then orchestrate chunking + embedding + storing for those files.

Design:
  - Index targets are configured via DEFAULT_TARGETS: a list of paths/globs
    relative to the workspace root (~/.local/share/stratum-lens/index-state.json
    tracks per-file mtime so we only re-index changed files).
  - Full re-index (--force) deletes stale chunks and re-embeds everything.
  - Incremental re-index checks mtime against last-indexed timestamp.
  - State file format: { "path": mtime_float, ... }

Target files (from your workspace):
  ~/.stratum-workspace/MEMORY.md          — long-term curated memory
  ~/.stratum-workspace/IDENTITY.md        — who your agent is
  ~/.stratum-workspace/SOUL.md            — values and aspirations
  ~/.stratum-workspace/USER.md            — about the user
  ~/.stratum-workspace/TOOLS.md           — tool notes and configs
  ~/.stratum-workspace/AGENTS.md          — workspace conventions
  ~/.stratum-workspace/memory/*.md        — daily notes and active context
  ~/.stratum-workspace/reports/markdown/  — deep reports (optional, large)
